# Advanced slurm

## Intro

Up to date state of the queue :
```
watch squeue -u yannick
```

## Dependencies

```
sbatch --dependency=<type:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]> ... submit.job
```

 * after:jobid[:jobid...] 	job can begin after the specified jobs have started
 * afterany:jobid[:jobid...] 	job can begin after the specified jobs have terminated
 * afternotok:jobid[:jobid...] 	job can begin after the specified jobs have failed
 * afterok:jobid[:jobid...] 	job can begin after the specified jobs have run to completion with an exit code of zero (see the user guide for caveats).
 * singleton 	jobs can begin execution after all previously launched jobs with the same name and user have ended. This is useful to collate results of a swarm or to send a notification at the end of a swarm.


## Arrays

Run 5 jobs **with the same jobid**.
The variable SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID contains the value, the job was sent with (here 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).

```
sbatch -a 1-5 submit.job
```
